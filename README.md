# Advent of Code

Now that I'm out of college, its much easier to find some time everyday to do these (or so I hope).
I've been eyeing Go for quite some time, so I figured why not learn it as we go? 
It should be pretty easy since it doesn't have many features to keep track of.

## Random impressions / comments 

### 12/3/23:
I feel like my programs are 2x as long as they would be in some other languages (namely TS). I really miss functional programming approaches 
for things like mapping / reducing arrays etc. I could obviously write some stream api for this, but that doesn't seem to be idiomatic. 

On a positive note, it feels incredibly straightforward (and barebones) to do what I need to do. Lots and lots of loops, lots of declaring 
a variable to maintain a state / accumulate a value etc. Reminds me a bit of when I first started learning to program and didn't think 
functions were too useful to write myself. 

In regards to this year's problems so far, I'd classify them as follows:
1. Simple string parsing, 1/10 difficulty
2. Parsing is the hardest part, 3/10 difficulty
3. BFS-ish, 4/10 difficulty (hardest part was figuring out how to parse the numbers from the graph)
